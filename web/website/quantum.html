  <h1>QUANTUM COMPUTING</h1>
  <p>Prerequisites - Basic linear algebra, complex numbers</p>

  Sections
  Quantum states
  -Classical bitstrings as vectors
  -Complex vectors
  -Magnitude of 1 (why? in the measurment section)
  Quantum computations
  -Unitary matrices (conjugate transpose) of determinant magnitude 1
  -Reversible
  -Examples of classical computations with unitary matrices
  Measurement
  -Turning quantum states into classical states (can't read quantum states!)
  Basic quantum gates
  -Approximate any unitary transformation
  -Like classical gates, could have more complicated ones in principle but then we'd have
   do design all these crazy gates. Instead use basic building blocks
  Relating to general QM
  -Tensor product and basis states
  -Entanglement
  -Quantum teleportation and no cloning
  -Hilbert space
  Hardware?

  Run this by a few people to see how they feel about things, what is confusing and such.
