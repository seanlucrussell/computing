  <h1>ABOUT</h1>
  My name is Sean Luc Russell. I am interested in math, science, computers,
  economics, psychology, like pretty much everything. So thats probably what
  I'm gonna write about.

  I use an informal register with a bunch of long words (like 'register')
  because I want to sound both approachable and smart.

  I'm a virgo but I thought I was a leo for a really long time because my
  birthday is right on the border.

  I'm not realy an expert in anything, but I am somewhat knowledgeable about
  a wide range of topics. I've always been pretty good at math but I was
  lazy in my primary education which annoyed my teachers.
