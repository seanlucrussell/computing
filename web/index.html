  <h1>MY NAME IS SEAN</h1>
  <p>This is a webpage. It got some things in it. Yaya! And
    this is my attempt to understand Umbral Moonshine.</p>
  <h2>Umbral Moonshine</h2>
  <p>In 1978, a mathematician by the name John McKay noticed
    that the field he was doing work in had a numerical
    connection with another completely separate part of math.
    His research focused on the monster group, and the other
    topic to understand is the j-function.</p>
  <h2>The Monster Group</h2>
  <p>There is a lot of background knowledge needed to
    understand all this stuff. So I'm gonna start with the
    proper definition of the monster group, and work backwards
    until I find something I understand.</p>
  <p>As per wikipedia, the monster group 'is the largest
    sporadic simple group'. So, from this it can be seen that
    I still have not a clue what that means.</p>
  <p>Over the past half century, the math community underwent
    a colossal effort to classify all the finite simple
    groups. A lot of these groups followed some structure,
    but there were 26 that defied all that and seemed to
    appear in a sporadic fashion, so the sporadic simple
    groups they were.</p>
  <p>The finite portion of finite simple group is easy to
    understand. A simple group is one whose only normal
    subgroups are itself and the trivial group.</p>
  <p>Alright, we are finally in territory I am almost
    familiar with. Group theory is based around a notion of
    groups, which are sets of items together with a group
    operation (like multiplication, for instance) that have
    certain properties. For instance, two items from the group
    composed with the group operation must result in another
    item of the group.</p>
  <p>So in the context of simple groups I can now define some
    things in terms I understand. A subgroup is a subset of a
    group that preserves the group operation, that is when two
    items from the subgroup are composed with the group
    operation the result is from that subgroup.</p>
  <p>The trivial group is a group whose only member is the
    identity. This is easy to understand I think (relative to
    the rest of this mess), as there are plenty of examples.
    0 is the identity of a group with addition as its
    operation, 1 for multiplication, and so on.</p>
  <p>The last definition needed for understanding simple
    groups is the definition of a normal subgroup.</p>
